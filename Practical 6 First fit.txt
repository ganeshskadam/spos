What this program does:
                      This program shows how a computer’s main memory (RAM) can be divided and allocated to different processes (programs) using a method called First Fit.
Main Concept Used:
                  Memory Management in Operating System
                  When multiple programs (processes) run together, the operating system must decide where to place each process in memory.
                  Memory is divided into small parts called blocks or partitions.
                  Each process needs some amount of memory to execute.
 Memory Allocation:-
The OS divides memory into fixed-size or variable-size blocks.
Each process requires a certain amount of memory. When a process arrives, the OS must decide which memory block should be given to that process.

First Fit Algorithm

Definition:
The First Fit algorithm allocates the first memory block that is large enough to accommodate a process.

Steps:
Start scanning memory blocks from the beginning.
When a block is found that is big enough for the process, allocate that block to the process.
Mark that block as allocated.
If no suitable block is found, the process remains unallocated.
The unused part of the allocated block (if any) is called internal fragmentation.

Internal Fragmentation:-
When a process does not fully utilize the memory block assigned to it, the unused portion of that block is called internal fragmentation.
It leads to wastage of memory inside allocated blocks.
